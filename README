1. About the Script

lite2do  is a lightweight command-line todo manager written in Perl.  Being
based on w2do and fully  compatible with its save file format,  it tries to
provide much simpler alternative for those who do not appreciate nor requi-
re w2do's complexity.


2. Script Usage

The basic usage is as follows:

  lite2do [OPTION...] COMMAND [ARGUMENT...]

The available commands are:

  list [@GROUP] [TEXT...]
  ls [@GROUP] [TEXT...]
    Display items  in the task list.  All tasks are listed by default,  but
    desired subset can be easily selected giving a group name, text pattern
    or combination of both.

  list %ID
  ls %ID
    Display task with selected id.

  add [@GROUP] TEXT...
    Add new item to the task list.

  change ID TEXT...
  mv ID TEXT...
    Change item with selected id in the task list.

  change ID @GROUP
  mv ID @GROUP
    Change group the item with selected id belongs to.

  finish ID
  fn ID
    Mark item with selected id as finished.

  revive ID
  re ID
    Mark item with selected id as unfinished.

  remove ID
  rm ID
    Remove item with selected id from the task list.

  undo
  ud
    Revert last action. When invoked, the data are restored from the backup
    file (i.e. ~/.lite2do.bak by default),  which is in turn deleted at the
    same time.

  groups
  gr
    Display list of groups in the task list  along with the number of tasks
    belonging to them.
  
  help [COMMAND]
    Display usage information.  By default,  list of all supported commands
    and command-line options is displayed. If the command is supplied, fur-
    ther information on its usage are displayed instead.

  version
    Display version information.

For the list of command-line options, either type `lite2do --help', or read
the corresponding manual page.
