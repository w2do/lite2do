1. General System Requirements

Since lite2do is a standalone script written in Perl 5, it should be mostly
platform independent.  However,  working installation of Perl 5 is required
in order to  run the script;  both 5.10.0 and 5.8.8  branches are known  to
work,  but other versions  might work as well.  If you are using  Unix-like
operating system, it is highly probable that you have it already installed.
If you are using Windows,  you can download the latest distribution free of
charge from <http://www.activestate.com/Products/activeperl/>.


2. Installing on Unix Systems

The easiest way  to install lite2do  on Unix operating system  (e.g. Linux,
various *BSD systems etc.) is to use the existing Makefile.  As a root, get
into the main directory of the lite2do source package and type:

  make install

This will install the executable  and the corresponding manual page  to the
predefined /usr/local/bin and /usr/local/share/man  respectively.  If these
locations do not satisfy your needs,  you can either edit the relevant part
of the Makefile, or you can change the prefix directly on the command line:

  make prefix=/some/location install

Similarly, typing

  make uninstall

or, if you have previously changed the destination directory,

  make prefix=/some/location uninstall

will completely remove all installed files.


3. Installing on Windows

No special installation is required in order to run lite2do on Windows.  In
your favourite command line interpreter (e.g. cmd.exe), simply get into the
main directory of the lite2do source package and type:

  perl lite2do [options]

Try `perl lite2do --help' for more information about the usage.
